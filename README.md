# BeerBong Battle

BeerBong Battle is a game between party members. It was designed to bring prople closer together with fun and drinking games. 

BeerBong Battle lets players connect with each other over the internet and compete with each other to see who can drink a beer the fastes in a beer bong. When a player is done dirnking the RaspberryPi and the connected sensors cand register it and send the time to the database and it will then give the results to the two players competing. 

The results and will be shown on the application which is made using Xamarin. The app running on the mobile device can connect to the BeerBong using a bluetooth connection. 


This project was implemented to get familiar with cross-platform development for mobile applications and RaspberryPi and a different array of sensors.
